A quick and easy contract to deploy an on-chain poll.  In the contract, enter the number of voting options you will need, voter whitelist, and timeleft then deploy your poll to the network of your choice.
Options are displayed on the front end, currently hard coded for a quick implementation.  Enter your info as necessary in App.jsx.
